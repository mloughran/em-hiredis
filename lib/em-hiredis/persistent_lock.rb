module EM::Hiredis
  # A lock that automatically re-acquires a lock before it loses it
  #
  # The lock is configured with the following two parameters
  #
  # :lock_timeout - Specifies how long each lock is acquired for. Setting
  #   this low means that locks need to be re-acquired very often, but a long
  #   timout means that a process that fails without cleaning up after itself
  #   (i.e. without releasing it's underlying lock) will block the anther
  #   process from picking up this lock
  #   replaced for a long while
  # :retry_interval - Specifies how frequently to retry acquiring the lock in
  #   the case that the lock is held by another process, or there's an error
  #   communicating with redis
  #
